     * Gets the process ID for a given domain by resolving it through ARNS and ANT services.
     * 
     * The domain can be in two formats:
     * 1. Simple domain (e.g., "randao") - The entire string is used as the ANT name
     * 2. Compound domain (e.g., "nft_randao") - Everything after the underscore is the ANT name
     * 
     * For domains with undernames (containing underscore):
     * - The part before the underscore is used as the undername
     * - The part after the underscore is used as the ANT name
     * - The process ID is retrieved from the undername record
     * 
     * For domains without undernames:
     * - The entire string is used as the ANT name
     * - The process ID is retrieved from the root record (@)
     * 
     * The resolution process:
     * 1. Validates the domain format
     * 2. Extracts ANT name and undername (if present)
     * 3. Checks for cached ANT service
     * 4. If not cached:
     *    - Gets ARNS record for domain
     *    - Creates and caches new ANT service
     * 5. Gets process ID from ANT record
     * 
     * @param domain - The domain to resolve. Can be either a Domain enum value or a custom domain string
     * @returns Promise resolving to the process ID string
     * @throws {InvalidDomainError} If the domain format is invalid
     * @throws {ARNSRecordNotFoundError} If no ARNS record exists for the domain
     * @throws {ANTRecordNotFoundError} If no ANT record exists for the ANT name
